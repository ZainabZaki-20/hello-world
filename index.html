      <p>Judge my music is a website which wittily utilizes AI to analyze people's music in order to "judge" it or form an assumption. I found this website really fun because of the humor integrated into the AI's responses. I don't usually like to interact with AI, but what piqued my interest it that this website doesn't use AI to actually digest your information, but rather to gain a laugh from the public. This use of technology to me, is where AI belongs, a tool that is unharmful but rather maintains as a sub-tool for people to use. Despite the website's simple designs, I really like how it pulled up the album/artist covers from my spotify to design to the webpage as it "read" my information.</p> <br>
