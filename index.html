      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Hello world, this is a paragraph tag</p>
      <h2><a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/10/judge-my-music/">Judge My Music</a></h2>
      <p>Judge my music is a website which wittily utilizes AI to analyze people's music in order to "judge" it or form an assumption. I found this website really fun because of the humor integrated into the AI's responses. I don't usually like to interact with AI, but what piqued my interest it that this website doesn't use AI to actually digest your information, but rather to gain a laugh from the public. This use of technology to me, is where AI belongs, a tool that is unharmful but rather maintains as a sub-tool for people to use. Despite the website's simple designs, I really like how it pulled up the album/artist covers from my spotify to design to the webpage as it "read" my information.</p> <br>
 <h1><a href=https://colorandcontrast.com/#/">Color & Contrast</a></h1>
      <p>Color & Constrast was a really informational website, because of it's good blend of interactiveness and information. As someone who hopes to get a UI/UX certification, it's good to find websites like this one to understand what really works for viewers. All of the information presented in this website is easy to understand, and is easy to navigate. There is a good balanc between words, graphics, and interactive parts to keep the viewer engaged until the very end. My biggest takeaway from this website is to learn how to create a good balance between available elements to ensure my viewers remain engaged and properly obtain whatever information it is that I'm presenting to them.</p> <br>
